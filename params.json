{"name":"ParaphraseAGH","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the Paraphrase AGH project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to help creating highly-concurrent multi-agent systems targeted at massively multicore hardware. The Paraphrase AGH project is part of the more general [Paraphrase](http://paraphrase-ict.eu/) research project. \r\n\r\n### Why we do this\r\n\r\n#### Efficiency\r\n\r\nMost multi-agent software come into two categories:\r\n\r\n* Heavy-grained agent programming (e.g. Jade), where every agent runs in a separate thread,\r\n* Fine-grained agent simulations (e.g. Netlogo), where the whole agent population is thread-contained.\r\n\r\nThe first approach is not efficient in computationally intensive simulations with large numbers of agents. [see TODOpaperRef] The second does not make use of the growing parallel capabilities of modern hardware. \r\n\r\nWe want to fill the gap and allow fine-grained agent-based simulations and computations which could be run efficiently on massively multicore hardware.\r\n\r\n#### Ease of use\r\n\r\nWriting a concurrent application is hard for most programmers. Writing a concurrent agent simulation is even harder. Moreover, most of the existing software tighly couples the agent programming model to the underlying execution model and parallelism type.\r\n\r\nWe want programmers to be able to design a multi-agent system at a high level which abstracts of the actual execution model. Then, such high level multi-agent patterns could be mapped to match a specific hardware by using the most adequate execution model for that hardware.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, multi-agent simulations and computations could be easily designed and tested and the same design could then be scaled out along with additional resources to solve harder problems or run bigger simulations.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n2013-2014\r\nDaniel Krzywicki\r\nJan Stypka\r\nPiotr Anielski\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
